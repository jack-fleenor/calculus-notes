* Graph representations of __Riemann Sums__.
* Reading and writing the __Riemann Sums__ in _Sigma_ notation.
* Reading and writing general _Sigma_ notation.
* Writing _definite integrals_ as a limit of a __Riemann Sum__ using *Sigma* notation.
* Interpret the definite integral as the net area of a curve.
* Interpret the integral as the net change given a rate of change.
* Using geometry to determine exact values of definite integrals.
* Properties of integrals.
  * Changing limits of integration.
  * Constant multiples.
  * Integrals of sums.
  * Integrals of differences.
* Application of the _Fundemental Theorem of Calculus_ (FTC) to evaluate definite integrals.
* Writing expressions involoving definite integrals to determine the area between two curves.
* estimating the average value of a function given the graph of a function or function you already should know.
* Determine the average value using a definite integral.
* Application problems.
* Guessing, checking, and tweaking anti-derivatives.

## Properties of Integrals

$\int_{a}^{b} f'(x)dx = f(b) - f(a)$

$f(b)=\int_{a}^{b}f'(x)dx$

$\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=F(b)-F(a)$

$F(b)=\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$

## Calculating Averages with Integrals

$\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$
